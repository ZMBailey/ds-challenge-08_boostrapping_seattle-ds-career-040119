# Bootstrapping Challenge

## Variable of Interest

We want to look at the 5th percentile of percentage of A's for classes at UW Madison from 2006-2017.

We chose the 5th percentile because we wanted to look at the lowest amount of A's given as we are looking for differences in the ratio of A's in our mod 2 project.
